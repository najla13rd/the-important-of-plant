<h3>Photosynthesis!</h3>
<br>
<p>Most life on Earth depends on photosynthesis.The process is carried out by plants, algae, and some types of bacteria, which capture energy from sunlight to produce oxygen (O2) and chemical energy stored in glucose (a sugar). Herbivores then obtain this energy by eating plants, and carnivores obtain it by eating herbivores.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>
    <br>
<p>During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the air and soil. Within the plant cell, the water is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains electrons. This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide into glucose. The plant then releases the oxygen back into the air, and stores energy within the glucose molecules.</p>

<h3>Chlorophyll</h3>
    <br>
<p>Inside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts, which store the energy of sunlight. Within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast is a light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for giving the plant its green color. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs energy from blue- and red-light waves, and reflects green-light waves, making the plant appear green.</p>

<h3>Light-dependent reactions vs. light-independent reactions</h3>
    <br>
<p>While there are many steps behind the process of photosynthesis, it can be broken down into two major stages: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reaction takes place within the thylakoid membrane and requires a steady stream of sunlight, hence the name light-dependent reaction. The chlorophyll absorbs energy from the light waves, which is converted into chemical energy in the form of the molecules ATP and NADPH. The light-independent stage, also known as the Calvin Cycle, takes place in the stroma, the space between the thylakoid membranes and the chloroplast membranes, and does not require light, hence the name light-independent reaction. During this stage, energy from the ATP and NADPH molecules is used to assemble carbohydrate molecules, like glucose, from carbon dioxide.</p>

<h3>C3 and C4 photosynthesis</h3>
    <br>
<p>Not all forms of photosynthesis are created equal, however. There are different types of photosynthesis, including C3 photosynthesis and C4 photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is used by the majority of plants. It involves producing a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglyceric acid during the Calvin Cycle, which goes on to become glucose. C4 photosynthesis, on the other hand, produces a four-carbon intermediate compound, which splits into carbon dioxide and a three-carbon compound during the Calvin Cycle. A benefit of C4 photosynthesis is that by producing higher levels of carbon, it allows plants to thrive in environments without much light or water.</p>

<h3>Animal Relationships</h3>
    <br>
<p>Forests, lawns, streams, and marshes are all habitats that are easily recognized as unique biotic 
communities. The interaction between plants and animals often exists out of the need for 
food, protection, transportation, and reproduction. The different kinds of interaction possible between 
organisms are extremely important in determining the abundance of species.</p>

<h3>Ecosystems</h3>
    <br>
<p>An ecosystem is the biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) factors of an ecological community considered together. Ecosystems contain four components: the physical environment (abiotic), living things (biotic), energy input and use, and nutrients that cycle between the biotic and abiotic components.In a given ecosystem, the interaction of organisms make up food chains. Usually, an organism has more than one source of food and is preyed on by more than one kind of organism. Under these conditions it is more appropriate to speak of a food web.</p>

<h3>Photosynthesis and Decomposition</h3>
    <br>
<p>Plants are one of the natural carbon “sinks” (natural systems that absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere). These naturally occurring “sinks” are critical in the effort to soak up some of the greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers are continuing to study the role plants can assist in reducing CO2 emissions and the relationships of such things as deforestation, reforestation, urbanization impacts on climate changes and global warming.</p>
<br>
    
<p>Involved in the return of nutrients to the ecosystem is the process of decomposition. In effect, decomposition is the reversal of photosynthesis - the reduction of organic matter into it's inorganic compounds (water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen).</p>

<h3>Composting</h3>
    <br>
<p>Composting is controlled decomposition that can be used in the garden as mulch or soil. It depends on microorganisms to feed on and break down plant debris. In order to do this the microorganisms also need oxygen and moisture. When incorporated back into the soil, compost increases the soils ability to retain moisture, improves drainage and aeration, supplies small amounts of nutrients, and increases the biological activity of soil organisms.</p>
